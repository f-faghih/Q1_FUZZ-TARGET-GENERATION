The first step in using libFuzzer on a library is to implement a fuzz target â€“ a function that accepts an array of bytes and does something interesting with these bytes using the API under test. Like this:
// fuzz_target.cc extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *Data, size_t Size) { DoSomethingInterestingWithMyAPI(Data, Size); return 0; // Values other than 0 and -1 are reserved for future use. } 
I think you have not considered this when writing the fuzz target.
